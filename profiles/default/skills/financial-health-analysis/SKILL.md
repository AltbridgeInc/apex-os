# Financial Health Analysis

## Overview

Assess company financial health through systematic analysis of revenue trends, profitability metrics, cash flow generation, and balance sheet strength to determine investment quality and risk.

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. Revenue Analysis
- Calculate revenue growth rate (YoY over 3-5 years)
- Assess revenue consistency and predictability
- Evaluate revenue quality (recurring vs one-time)
- Identify cyclicality and economic sensitivity

### 2. Profitability Metrics
- Calculate gross margin: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- Calculate operating margin: Operating Income / Revenue
- Calculate net margin: Net Income / Revenue
- Analyze margin trends (expanding, stable, contracting)

### 3. Cash Flow Evaluation
- Calculate operating cash flow (OCF)
- Calculate free cash flow (FCF): OCF - Capital Expenditures
- Assess cash conversion: FCF / Net Income (target >1)
- Calculate FCF yield: FCF / Market Cap

### 4. Balance Sheet Strength
- Calculate debt-to-equity ratio: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
- Calculate current ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Calculate interest coverage: EBIT / Interest Expense
- Assess cash position and liquidity

## Scoring Guidelines

**Score 9-10 (Excellent):**
- Revenue growing >15% YoY consistently
- Expanding margins across all levels
- Strong FCF with >100% cash conversion
- Fortress balance sheet (low debt, high cash)

**Score 7-8 (Strong):**
- Revenue growing 10-15% YoY
- Stable to improving margins
- Positive and growing FCF
- Healthy balance sheet

**Score 5-6 (Average):**
- Revenue growing 5-10% YoY
- Stable margins
- Positive but inconsistent FCF
- Manageable debt levels

**Score 3-4 (Weak):**
- Revenue growing <5% or declining
- Contracting margins
- Inconsistent or negative FCF
- High debt levels

**Score 0-2 (Poor):**
- Revenue declining consistently
- Negative or severely contracting margins
- Burning cash (negative FCF)
- Dangerous debt levels

## Red Flags

Identify and flag:
- Accounting quality issues (revenue recognition games, frequent restatements)
- Deteriorating margins (gross or operating compression)
- Cash flow divergence (net income up but FCF down)
- Debt spiral (debt increasing faster than revenue/assets)
- Working capital issues (receivables/inventory ballooning)

## Output Format

Provide financial health score (0-10) with supporting metrics and rationale. Reference detailed principles in `references/financial-health-principles.md` for comprehensive evaluation criteria.
