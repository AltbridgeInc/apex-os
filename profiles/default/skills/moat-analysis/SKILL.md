# Moat Analysis

## Overview

Identify and evaluate sustainable competitive advantages that create barriers to entry and protect long-term economic returns.

## Types of Moats

### 1. Network Effects
- Value increases with each additional user
- High switching costs due to network lock-in
- Examples: Social platforms, marketplaces, payment networks
- Assessment: Measure active users, engagement, network density

### 2. Intangible Assets
- Brand recognition and customer loyalty
- Patents and proprietary technology
- Regulatory licenses and approvals
- Assessment: Brand value metrics, patent portfolio strength

### 3. Cost Advantages
- Economies of scale
- Proprietary process technology
- Favorable access to resources
- Geographic advantages
- Assessment: Unit cost comparison to competitors

### 4. Switching Costs
- High customer switching costs (time, money, risk)
- Integration complexity
- Data/workflow dependency
- Assessment: Customer retention rates, lifetime value

### 5. Efficient Scale
- Market naturally supports limited competitors
- Duopoly or oligopoly dynamics
- High fixed costs creating barriers
- Assessment: Market concentration, competitor profitability
