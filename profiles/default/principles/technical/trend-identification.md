# Trend Identification

## Principle

"The trend is your friend" - Trading with the prevailing trend dramatically increases probability of success. Trend identification determines market direction and strength across multiple timeframes, forming the foundation of technical analysis.

## Trend Definition

### Uptrend
**Structure**:
- Series of higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL)
- Price consistently making progress upward
- Dips are bought (support at higher levels)

**Visual**: ↗️ Staircase pattern ascending

### Downtrend
**Structure**:
- Series of lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL)
- Price consistently making progress downward
- Rallies are sold (resistance at lower levels)

**Visual**: ↘️ Staircase pattern descending

### Sideways/Range
**Structure**:
- Price oscillating between support and resistance
- No clear directional bias
- Equal highs and lows

**Visual**: ➡️ Horizontal channel

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

**Critical Concept**: Analyze multiple timeframes to understand context

### Monthly Chart (Long-term Trend)
**Purpose**: Macro trend direction
- **Timeframe**: 5-10 years of data
- **Usage**: Understand big picture, avoid fighting major trends
- **Example**: Is this a long-term bull or bear market?

### Weekly Chart (Intermediate Trend)
**Purpose**: Position trend direction
- **Timeframe**: 1-2 years of data
- **Usage**: Identify primary trend for swing trades
- **Example**: Is current move part of larger uptrend or just a bounce?

### Daily Chart (Short-term Trend)
**Purpose**: Entry and exit timing
- **Timeframe**: 3-6 months of data
- **Usage**: Fine-tune entry/exit points
- **Example**: When to enter within the larger uptrend?

**Ideal Alignment**: All three timeframes in same direction (highest probability)

**Example - Strongest Setup**:
- Monthly: Uptrend (HH, HL for years)
- Weekly: Uptrend (HH, HL for months)
- Daily: Pulling back to support (buying opportunity)

## Trend Identification Tools

### 1. Moving Averages (MAs)

**Key Moving Averages**:
- **20-day MA** (short-term): Immediate trend
- **50-day MA** (intermediate): Primary trend for swing trades
- **200-day MA** (long-term): Major trend, institutional support/resistance

**Trend Signals**:

**Bullish**:
- Price > 20 > 50 > 200 MA (MAs in proper order)
- All MAs sloping upward
- Price bounces off MAs as support

**Bearish**:
- Price < 20 < 50 < 200 MA (inverted order)
- All MAs sloping downward
- MAs act as resistance on rallies

**Neutral**:
- MAs intertwined or flat
- Price choppy around MAs
- No clear directional bias

**Golden Cross** (Bullish):
- 50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA
- Signals potential long-term uptrend beginning

**Death Cross** (Bearish):
- 50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA
- Signals potential long-term downtrend beginning

### 2. Trendlines

**How to Draw**:
- **Uptrend Line**: Connect series of higher lows
- **Downtrend Line**: Connect series of lower highs
- **Validation**: Need at least 3 touches

**Significance**:
- More touches = stronger trendline
- Longer duration = more significant
- Steeper angle = stronger but less sustainable

**Usage**:
- **Support**: Uptrend line acts as support (buy zone)
- **Resistance**: Downtrend line acts as resistance (sell zone)
- **Break**: Trendline break signals potential trend change

**Example**:
```
Uptrend: Touch 1 (week 1) → Touch 2 (week 4) → Touch 3 (week 8)
Each touch is a higher low, confirming uptrend
```

### 3. ADX (Average Directional Index)

**Purpose**: Measures trend strength (not direction)

**Interpretation**:
- **ADX > 25**: Strong trend (trade with trend)
- **ADX 20-25**: Developing trend
- **ADX < 20**: Weak trend or ranging (avoid trend following)

**Usage with +DI and -DI**:
- **+DI above -DI + ADX > 25**: Strong uptrend (buy)
- **-DI above +DI + ADX > 25**: Strong downtrend (sell/avoid)
- **ADX < 20**: Choppy, range-bound (use mean reversion strategies)

**Note**: ADX tells you HOW STRONG the trend is, not WHICH DIRECTION

### 4. Price Action Structure

**Uptrend Confirmation**:
- Each rally exceeds previous high
- Each pullback holds above previous low
- Pullbacks shallow (20-30%) and brief
- Rallies strong and sustained

**Downtrend Confirmation**:
- Each decline exceeds previous low
- Each bounce fails below previous high
- Bounces brief and weak
- Declines strong and sustained

**Trend Weakening Signs**:
- Failing to make new highs (uptrend) or new lows (downtrend)
- Pullbacks deeper than usual
- Momentum divergence (price up, indicators down)
- Volume declining on trend moves

## Trend Strength Assessment

### Strong Trend (Score 9-10)
- Clear HH/HL (uptrend) or LH/LL (downtrend) for 3+ months
- All timeframes aligned (monthly, weekly, daily)
- Price > 50-day and 200-day MA by >5%
- ADX > 30
- Moving averages in proper order and sloping strongly
- Clean, steady progression

### Good Trend (Score 7-8)
- HH/HL or LH/LL pattern established
- Weekly and daily aligned (monthly may differ)
- Price above 50-day MA
- ADX 25-30
- Some volatility but overall directional

### Moderate Trend (Score 5-6)
- Trend present but choppy
- Price near 50-day MA
- ADX 20-25
- Daily and weekly may conflict
- Sideways periods within trend

### Weak Trend (Score 3-4)
- Unclear direction
- Price whipping around MAs
- ADX < 20
- Timeframes conflicting
- More range-bound than trending

### No Trend (Score 0-2)
- Completely sideways
- Price oscillating
- ADX < 15
- Flat moving averages
- Range-trading environment

## Trading with the Trend

### In Uptrends
**Strategy**: Buy pullbacks, ride rallies
- **Entry**: When price pulls back to support (MA, trendline)
- **Exit**: When uptrend breaks (below 50-day MA on volume)
- **Stop**: Below recent swing low
- **Targets**: Previous high, then extensions

**Never**: Short into strong uptrend

### In Downtrends
**Strategy**: Avoid or short rallies
- **Entry**: When price bounces to resistance
- **Exit**: When downtrend breaks (above 50-day MA)
- **Stop**: Above recent swing high

**Best Practice**: Avoid stocks in downtrends (hard to call bottoms)

### In Sideways
**Strategy**: Range trading or wait
- **Entry**: Buy support, sell resistance
- **Exit**: Opposite end of range
- **Stop**: Outside range

**Alternative**: Wait for breakout (trend resumption)

## Trend Change Recognition

### Signs Uptrend May Be Ending
- Lower high made (breaking HH pattern)
- Break below 50-day MA on volume
- 20-day MA crosses below 50-day MA
- ADX declining from peak
- Volume declining on rallies

### Signs Downtrend May Be Ending
- Higher low made (breaking LL pattern)
- Break above 50-day MA on volume
- 20-day MA crosses above 50-day MA
- Volume increasing on bounces

**Important**: Trend change is a process, not an event. Don't try to call exact tops/bottoms.

## Application in APEX-OS

### Pre-Investment
- Analyze monthly, weekly, daily charts
- Identify trend on each timeframe
- Check MA alignment and slopes
- Calculate ADX on daily and weekly
- Confirm HH/HL or LH/LL structure
- Assign trend score (0-10)
- **Requirement**: Daily trend score ≥7 for long positions

### During Hold Period
- Monitor daily trend weekly
- Watch for trend weakening signs
- Track MA slopes and crossovers
- Note ADX declining
- Update trend score monthly

### Exit Triggers
- Break of daily uptrend (close below 50-day MA on volume)
- Lower high made (breaks HH pattern)
- Death cross (50-day below 200-day)
- ADX declining below 20
- Trendline break on volume

## Best Practices

1. **Higher Timeframe First**: Start with monthly, then weekly, then daily
2. **Alignment Matters**: All timeframes in sync = highest probability
3. **Trend > Opinion**: Trade the trend you see, not the one you want
4. **Respect Trend Until Broken**: Don't anticipate reversals
5. **Bigger Trend Dominates**: Daily uptrend means little in weekly downtrend

## Common Mistakes

- Fighting the trend (shorting uptrends, buying downtrends)
- Ignoring higher timeframes (daily trader unaware of weekly downtrend)
- Calling tops and bottoms (anticipating vs reacting)
- Using only one indicator (use multiple confirmations)
- Switching timeframes to fit bias (confirmation bias)
- Not respecting trend changes (stubbornly holding after break)

## Integration with APEX-OS

- **technical-analyst** agent applies this principle
- Trend score (0-10) feeds into overall technical score
- Trend strength determines position aggressiveness
- Trend break triggers exit signal
- Multi-timeframe analysis required before entry
