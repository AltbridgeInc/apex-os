# Volume Analysis

## Principle

Volume is the fuel that drives price moves. It represents the level of conviction behind price action and confirms or questions the validity of trends and patterns. Volume precedes price - analyzing volume gives early signals of potential reversals, breakouts, and exhaustion. "Volume is truth."

## Core Concepts

### What Volume Tells Us
- **Conviction**: High volume = strong conviction, low volume = weak conviction
- **Validation**: Volume confirms price moves as legitimate vs noise
- **Participation**: Shows institutional involvement (they move volume)
- **Momentum**: Expanding volume shows accelerating momentum
- **Divergence**: Volume-price divergences signal potential reversals

### Volume Principles

**Principle 1**: Volume should expand in direction of trend
- Uptrend: Higher volume on up days than down days
- Downtrend: Higher volume on down days than up days

**Principle 2**: Volume contracts during consolidations
- Consolidations/ranges: Volume declines (coiling)
- Low volume = energy building for breakout

**Principle 3**: Volume confirms breakouts
- Real breakout: Volume 1.5-2× average
- False breakout: Volume below average

**Principle 4**: Climax volume signals exhaustion
- Parabolic move + massive volume spike = often marks top/bottom
- Buying/selling exhaustion

## Volume Patterns and Signals

### 1. Volume Confirmation

**Healthy Uptrend**:
- Rising prices + rising volume = sustainable
- Each rally has higher volume than prior rally
- Pullbacks have lower volume than rallies

**Pattern**:
```
Day 1: +2% on 5M volume
Day 2: +1% on 3M volume (pullback, low volume ✓)
Day 3: +3% on 7M volume (higher high, higher volume ✓)
```

**Unhealthy Uptrend** (Warning):
- Rising prices + declining volume = weak
- Buying pressure fading
- Pullbacks have equal/higher volume than rallies

**Pattern**:
```
Day 1: +2% on 5M volume
Day 2: +1% on 3M volume
Day 3: +1% on 2M volume ← Volume declining (warning)
```

### 2. Volume Divergence

**Bullish Divergence** (Potential Bottom):
- Price making lower lows
- Volume declining on each low
- Selling pressure exhausting

**Example**:
```
Low 1: $50 on 10M volume
Low 2: $48 on 7M volume (lower price, less volume)
Low 3: $47 on 4M volume (even lower price, even less volume)
Signal: Sellers exhausted, potential bottom
```

**Bearish Divergence** (Potential Top):
- Price making higher highs
- Volume declining on each high
- Buying pressure fading

**Example**:
```
High 1: $100 on 15M volume
High 2: $105 on 10M volume (higher price, less volume)
High 3: $108 on 6M volume (even higher price, even less volume)
Signal: Buyers exhausted, potential top
```

### 3. Climax Volume (Exhaustion)

**Buying Climax** (Top Signal):
- Parabolic price move accelerates
- Massive volume spike (3-5× average)
- Followed by reversal or consolidation

**Characteristics**:
- Gap up on huge volume
- Wide-range candle
- Unsustainable momentum
- Everyone who wants to buy has bought

**Selling Climax** (Bottom Signal):
- Panic selling accelerates
- Massive volume spike (3-5× average)
- Followed by relief rally

**Characteristics**:
- Gap down on huge volume
- Capitulation
- Everyone who wants to sell has sold
- Often marks intermediate/major bottoms

**Trading Implication**:
- Don't chase parabolic moves with climax volume
- Look for reversal after climax (exhaustion gap)

### 4. Volume Dry Up (Coiling)

**Pattern**:
- Volume progressively declining
- Tightening price range
- Energy building (spring coiling)

**Typical Before**:
- Breakouts from consolidation
- Major directional moves
- Volatility expansion

**Trading Implication**:
- Low volume after trend = coiling for next move
- Position before breakout (once volume confirms direction)

**Example**:
```
Week 1: 50M volume, range $48-52
Week 2: 35M volume, range $49-51
Week 3: 20M volume, range $49.50-$50.50
Week 4: 10M volume, range $49.75-$50.25 ← Dry up
Breakout: $53 on 80M volume → Explosive move
```

### 5. Volume Surge on Breakout

**Healthy Breakout**:
- Volume 1.5-2× average minimum
- Ideally 2-3× or more
- Shows strong conviction
- More likely to sustain

**Weak Breakout**:
- Volume below or barely above average
- Lacks conviction
- Higher probability of failure
- Often "false breakout"

**Threshold**: Require minimum 1.5× average volume for breakout confirmation

### 6. Volume on Pullbacks vs Rallies

**Accumulation** (Bullish):
- Up days: Higher volume
- Down days: Lower volume
- Institutional buying (smart money)

**Example**:
```
Up day: +2% on 8M volume
Down day: -1% on 3M volume
Up day: +3% on 10M volume
Down day: -1% on 2M volume
Pattern: Volume 3-5× higher on up days = accumulation
```

**Distribution** (Bearish):
- Up days: Lower volume
- Down days: Higher volume
- Institutional selling (smart money exiting)

**Example**:
```
Up day: +1% on 3M volume
Down day: -2% on 9M volume
Up day: +1% on 2M volume
Down day: -3% on 12M volume
Pattern: Volume 3-5× higher on down days = distribution
```

### 7. Volume at Support and Resistance

**High Volume at Support**:
- Many buyers defending level
- Strong support
- Good risk/reward for long

**Low Volume at Support**:
- Weak defense
- Support may break easily
- Risky to buy

**High Volume at Resistance**:
- Heavy supply/selling
- Strong resistance
- Difficult to break
- May need multiple attempts

**Low Volume at Resistance**:
- Light supply
- May break easily
- Coiled spring ready to break

## Volume Indicators

### Average Volume

**Calculation**: Average daily volume over 30-50 days

**Usage**:
- Compare current volume to average
- >1.5× average = significant
- >2× average = very significant
- <0.5× average = very low participation

### Relative Volume (RVOL)

**Calculation**: Current volume / Average volume at this time

**Intraday Usage**:
- RVOL = 2.0 means 2× normal volume for this time of day
- Useful for spotting unusual activity early

### Volume Moving Average

**20-day Volume MA**:
- Smooth volume trends
- Spot volume expansion/contraction
- Volume MA rising = increasing participation
- Volume MA falling = declining participation

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

**Calculation**:
- Up day: Add volume to OBV
- Down day: Subtract volume from OBV

**Usage**:
- OBV trend confirms price trend
- OBV divergence signals potential reversal

**Bullish Divergence**:
- Price: Lower lows
- OBV: Higher lows (accumulation despite lower prices)

**Bearish Divergence**:
- Price: Higher highs
- OBV: Lower highs (distribution despite higher prices)

### Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

**Definition**: Average price weighted by volume

**Intraday Usage**:
- Price above VWAP = bullish
- Price below VWAP = bearish
- Institutional benchmark (institutions aim to trade near VWAP)

**Trading**:
- Pullback to VWAP in uptrend = buying opportunity
- Bounce to VWAP in downtrend = selling opportunity

## Volume Scoring Criteria

### Excellent Volume Pattern (Score 9-10)
- Volume expanding strongly with trend (2-3× avg on trend days)
- Volume declining on counter-trend days (<0.5× avg)
- Clear accumulation pattern (volume on up > down by 3×+)
- Volume surge on breakout (>2× average)
- OBV confirming price trend strongly
- No negative divergences

### Good Volume Pattern (Score 7-8)
- Volume generally expanding with trend (1.5-2× avg)
- Volume usually lower on pullbacks
- Accumulation visible (volume on up > down by 2×)
- Breakout volume acceptable (1.5-2× avg)
- OBV generally confirming

### Average Volume Pattern (Score 5-6)
- Volume mixed but acceptable
- Some divergences but not major
- Breakout volume marginal (~1.5× avg)
- OBV neither confirming nor diverging strongly

### Weak Volume Pattern (Score 3-4)
- Volume declining on rallies (warning)
- Distribution visible (volume higher on down days)
- Breakout volume weak (<1.5× avg)
- OBV diverging negatively

### Poor Volume Pattern (Score 0-2)
- Volume extremely weak (<0.5× avg consistently)
- Strong negative divergence
- No volume on breakout attempt
- Clear distribution pattern
- OBV in strong negative divergence

## Red Flags (Volume Warnings)

### Danger Signs
- **Rising price + falling volume**: Weak rally, likely to fail
- **Breakout on low volume**: False breakout likely
- **Climax volume spike**: Exhaustion, reversal possible
- **Volume surge on gap down**: Panic selling (could be bottom, but risky)
- **Heavy volume at top**: Distribution (smart money exiting)

### Early Warning Signals
- OBV diverging from price (2+ weeks)
- Volume declining during uptrend (3+ weeks)
- Heavy volume on down days vs up days (accumulation/distribution shift)
- Volume spike followed by immediate reversal (absorption)

## Application in APEX-OS

### Pre-Investment Analysis
- Review 3-6 months of volume patterns
- Compare recent volume to 50-day average
- Check for accumulation/distribution patterns
- Analyze volume at key S/R levels
- Calculate OBV and check for divergences
- Assign volume score (0-10)

**Requirements for Entry**:
- Volume score ≥ 6 (avoid weak volume setups)
- No significant bearish divergences
- Accumulation pattern preferred
- If near breakout, require 1.5× volume minimum on breakout

### During Hold Period
- Monitor daily volume vs average
- Watch for distribution pattern developing
- Check OBV for divergences weekly
- Track volume on pullbacks (should be low)
- Alert if volume pattern deteriorates

### Exit Triggers
- **Climax Volume**: Massive spike (3× avg) with wide range candle
- **Distribution Pattern**: Volume consistently higher on down days (3+ weeks)
- **OBV Divergence**: OBV declining while price rising (2+ weeks)
- **Volume Dries Up**: Extremely low volume during uptrend (interest fading)
- **Heavy Volume Break of Support**: >2× avg volume on break = conviction

## Best Practices

1. **Always Check Volume**: Never trade based on price alone
2. **Volume Confirms**: Require volume confirmation for breakouts (1.5× minimum)
3. **Watch for Divergence**: OBV divergence is early warning system
4. **Climax = Exhaustion**: Avoid chasing parabolic moves with volume spikes
5. **Context Matters**: High volume break of support is different than high volume breakout
6. **Accumulation > Distribution**: Only trade stocks showing accumulation

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring volume entirely (biggest mistake)
- Trading breakouts without volume confirmation
- Not recognizing distribution (volume on down days)
- Chasing climax volume spikes
- Not using volume moving averages for context
- Treating all volume the same (context matters: breakout vs breakdown)
- Forgetting to check OBV for divergences

## Resources

- **Volume data**: Available on all major platforms (free)
- **OBV**: Standard indicator on most platforms
- **VWAP**: Available on intraday charts
- **Relative Volume**: Many scanners provide (FinViz, TradingView)

## Integration with APEX-OS

- **technical-analyst** agent applies this principle
- Volume score (0-10) feeds into overall technical score
- Volume confirmation required for all breakout entries
- Volume divergence triggers alerts from **portfolio-monitor**
- Climax volume can trigger early profit taking
- Distribution pattern invalidates thesis (exit signal)
