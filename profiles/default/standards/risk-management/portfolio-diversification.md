# Portfolio Diversification and Correlation

## Principle

Diversification reduces portfolio volatility and drawdown risk by spreading capital across uncorrelated assets. However, over-diversification dilutes returns and makes management unwieldy. The goal is "adequate diversification" - enough to reduce risk, not so much that you can't follow your positions. **Concentrate enough to matter, diversify enough to sleep.**

## Core Concepts

### Why Diversify?

**Risk Reduction**:
- One stock can go to zero (100% loss)
- Portfolio of 10 stocks unlikely all fail
- Reduces single-stock risk (company-specific events)

**Volatility Smoothing**:
- Individual stocks: ±30-50% volatility common
- Portfolio of 8-10: ±15-25% volatility
- Smoother ride, less emotional stress

**Drawdown Protection**:
- Single stock can drop 50-70% in bear market
- Diversified portfolio typically drops 20-40%
- Faster recovery from diversified portfolio

**The Math**:
- 50% loss requires 100% gain to recover
- 30% loss requires 43% gain to recover
- 20% loss requires 25% gain to recover

**Diversification reduces maximum drawdown = easier recovery**

### Why NOT Over-Diversify?

**Dilu

ted Returns**:
- 30 positions: Hard to beat index (you basically are the index)
- Best ideas get diluted by mediocre ideas
- Peter Lynch: "Owning stocks is like having children—don't get involved with more than you can handle"

**Management Burden**:
- Hard to track 20+ stocks
- Miss important news or changes
- Can't deeply research all positions

**Commission Costs**:
- More positions = more trades = more costs
- Spreads and slippage add up

**False Security**:
- 30 tech stocks ≠ diversified (all correlated)
- Diversification requires low correlation

### The Sweet Spot

**Research Consensus**: 8-12 stocks provides optimal diversification
- 80-90% of diversification benefit achieved
- Still manageable
- Best ideas get meaningful weight

**For Individual Investors**:
- **Minimum**: 5 stocks (less = too concentrated)
- **Target**: 8-10 stocks (sweet spot)
- **Maximum**: 15 stocks (more = over-diversified, index-like)

## Position Sizing Guidelines

### Individual Position Size

**Target Range**: 8-12% per position

**Example** (10 positions):
- Each position: 10% of portfolio
- 80% cash reserves
- Room for 2 more positions or averaging up

**Constraints**:
- **Minimum**: 3-5% (too small = not worth tracking)
- **Maximum**: 15% (too large = concentrated risk)

**Reasoning**:
- 10% position × 8 positions = 80% invested
- 20% cash reserve for new opportunities
- If one position doubles: Now 20%, trim to 12%, redeploy

### Why Not Equal Weight?

**Conviction-Based Sizing**:
- High conviction (9-10 scores): 12-15% position
- Medium conviction (7-8): 8-10% position
- Lower conviction (6-7): 5-7% position

**Risk-Adjusted Sizing**:
- Low volatility, tight stop: Can be larger (12-15%)
- High volatility, wide stop: Must be smaller (5-8%)
- Maintains consistent 1-2% portfolio risk

**Example**:
- Stock A: High conviction, tight stop → 12% position
- Stock B: Medium conviction, standard → 10% position
- Stock C: Lower conviction or wider stop → 6% position

## Sector Diversification

### Sector Concentration Limits

**Maximum per Sector**: 50% of portfolio

**Preferred**: 25-35% per sector

**Reasoning**:
- Sectors move together (correlation)
- Sector rotation happens
- Regulations can impact entire sectors

**Example (Portfolio)**:
- Technology: 30%
- Healthcare: 25%
- Consumer Discretionary: 20%
- Financials: 15%
- Industrials: 10%
- Cash: 20%

### Sector Correlation

**High Correlation** (Move Together):
- All tech stocks drop together in tech selloff
- All energy stocks rise with oil price
- All banks react to interest rates

**Low Correlation** (Move Independently):
- Tech + utilities (different drivers)
- Healthcare + consumer staples (defensive vs cyclical)
- Gold miners + financials (inverse sometimes)

**Goal**: Hold positions with low/moderate correlation

### Sector Cycles

**Early Cycle** (Recovery):
- Cyclicals lead: Industrials, Materials
- Financials improve

**Mid Cycle** (Growth):
- Technology, Consumer Discretionary
- Broad participation

**Late Cycle** (Peak):
- Energy outperforms
- Financials peak

**Recession**:
- Defensives outperform: Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Utilities
- Cyclicals underperform

**Strategy**: Adjust sector weights based on cycle

## Correlation and Portfolio Heat

### Understanding Correlation

**Correlation** (-1 to +1):
- **+1**: Perfect positive correlation (move exactly together)
- **0**: No correlation (independent movements)
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation (move exactly opposite)

**Example Correlations**:
- AAPL + MSFT: ~0.7 (high positive)
- AAPL + Gold: ~0.1 (low correlation)
- AAPL + VIX: ~-0.6 (negative correlation)

### False Diversification

**Problem**: Holding 10 tech stocks is NOT diversified

**Example (False Diversification)**:
- 10% AAPL
- 10% MSFT
- 10% GOOGL
- 10% NVDA
- 10% AMD
- 10% CRM
- 10% ADBE
- 10% NOW
- 10% SNOW
- 10% DDOG

**Issue**: All highly correlated (~0.6-0.8)
- Tech selloff: All drop 30%
- Portfolio drops 30% (no diversification benefit)

**Solution**: Diversify across sectors, not within

**True Diversification**:
- 10% AAPL (Tech)
- 10% JNJ (Healthcare)
- 10% XOM (Energy)
- 10% JPM (Finance)
- 10% CAT (Industrial)
- 10% PG (Consumer Staples)
- 10% HD (Consumer Discretionary)
- 10% LMT (Defense)
- 20% Cash

### Portfolio Risk (Heat) Management

**Portfolio Heat**: Total risk exposure across all positions

**Calculation**:
```
Portfolio Heat = Σ (Position $ Size × % to Stop) for all positions
```

**Example**:
```
Position A: $10,000, 5% to stop = $500 risk
Position B: $10,000, 7% to stop = $700 risk
Position C: $8,000, 6% to stop = $480 risk
Total Heat = $1,680

If Portfolio = $100,000 → Heat = 1.68%
```

**Alternatively (Simpler)**:
```
Position A: 1.5% portfolio risk
Position B: 1.5% portfolio risk
Position C: 1.0% portfolio risk
Total Heat = 4.0%
```

**Guidelines**:
- **Maximum**: 8% total portfolio heat
- **Target**: 5-6% typical
- **Conservative**: 3-4% in uncertain markets

**Why This Matters**:
- If all stops hit simultaneously: Lose 8% (manageable)
- Without limit: Could lose 20-30% if all stop out
- Prevents overexposure

## Cash Reserves

### Importance of Cash

**Benefits**:
- Opportunity fund (capitalize on pullbacks)
- Reduces volatility
- Psychological cushion
- Dry powder for corrections

**Minimum**: 20% cash at all times

**Target Range**:
- Bull market, plenty of setups: 15-20% cash
- Normal market: 20-30% cash
- Uncertain market, few setups: 30-50% cash
- Bear market or no opportunities: 50-80% cash

**Never Go 100% Invested**:
- No cash = can't act on opportunities
- Forced to sell position to buy new one
- Psychological pressure (no reserves)

### Building vs Deploying Cash

**Building Cash** (Taking Chips Off Table):
- Take profits, don't reinvest immediately
- Let cash build to 30-40%
- Signals: Late cycle, expensive valuations, fewer setups

**Deploying Cash** (Going More Aggressive):
- Find high-quality setups
- Deploy to 80-85% invested
- Signals: Early cycle, corrections, many setups

**Golden Rule**: **Cash is a position** (not "sitting on sidelines")
- Sometimes best move is no move
- Cash prevents forcing trades

## Position Limits and Rules

### Number of Positions

**Minimum**: 5 positions
- Less = too concentrated
- One bad trade = large impact

**Target**: 8-10 positions
- Sweet spot for diversification
- Manageable to track
- Best ideas get weight

**Maximum**: 15 positions
- More = diluted returns
- Hard to manage
- Index-like performance

### Adding New Positions

**Before Adding, Check**:
- [ ] Sector exposure: Will new position exceed 50% in sector?
- [ ] Portfolio heat: Will total risk exceed 8%?
- [ ] Cash reserve: Will cash drop below 15%?
- [ ] Correlation: Is this highly correlated with existing positions?
- [ ] Opportunity cost: Is this better than smallest current position?

**If Any Red Flags**: Either pass or exit existing position first

### Position Rebalancing

**When Position Grows Too Large**:

**Example**:
- Initial: 10% position
- Stock doubles: Now 20% of portfolio
- Action: Trim to 12%, bank 8%

**Why**:
- Single stock risk too high (20% is over limit)
- Concentrates portfolio (other positions now smaller %)
- Taking profit is prudent

**When**: Any position exceeds 15%, trim to 12%

## Style Diversification

### Growth vs Value

**Don't Go All-In On One Style**:
- All growth: Crushed in growth selloffs (2022)
- All value: Miss growth rallies (2020-2021)

**Balance**:
- 60-70% growth (if growth investor)
- 30-40% value/quality (balance)
- Adapt to market environment

### Market Cap Diversification

**Mix Sizes**:
- Large cap (>$200B): 40-50% (stability)
- Mid cap ($10-200B): 30-40% (growth + stability)
- Small cap (<$10B): 10-20% (growth, higher risk)

**Avoid**: All small caps (too volatile) or all mega caps (slow growth)

### Geographic Diversification

**For US Investors**:
- 70-80% US stocks (home market, currency)
- 20-30% international (diversification)

**Considerations**:
- Currency risk
- Political risk
- Accounting standards
- Less information

**Practical**: Most US large caps have global exposure (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)

## Monitoring and Adjustments

### Weekly Review

**Check**:
- [ ] Number of positions (5-15 range?)
- [ ] Largest position (<15%?)
- [ ] Total portfolio heat (<8%?)
- [ ] Sector concentration (<50% any sector?)
- [ ] Cash reserve (>15%?)

### Monthly Review

**Deeper Analysis**:
- Position size distribution (any outliers?)
- Sector allocation changes
- Correlation analysis (positions moving together?)
- Risk/reward profile of portfolio
- Opportunities to rebalance

### Rebalancing Triggers

**Trim Position If**:
- Exceeds 15% of portfolio
- Sector exceeds 50%
- Thesis weakening (take profits early)

**Add Position If**:
- High-quality setup
- Portfolio heat <6%
- Sector <40%
- Cash >25%

**Exit Position If**:
- Thesis falsified
- Better opportunity (upgrade portfolio)
- Need to free capital (hit limits)

## Common Diversification Mistakes

### Mistake 1: False Diversification
**Problem**: 10 tech stocks = not diversified
**Solution**: Diversify across sectors

### Mistake 2: Over-Diversification
**Problem**: 30 positions = can't manage, diluted returns
**Solution**: Keep 8-15 positions maximum

### Mistake 3: Under-Diversification
**Problem**: 2-3 positions = concentrated risk
**Solution**: Build to 5-10 positions minimum

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Correlation
**Problem**: "I have 10 stocks" but all highly correlated
**Solution**: Check sector and correlation

### Mistake 5: No Cash Reserve
**Problem**: 100% invested, can't take advantage of opportunities
**Solution**: Maintain 15-20% cash minimum

### Mistake 6: Equal Weighting
**Problem**: Best idea = 10%, worst idea = 10%
**Solution**: Size by conviction and risk

### Mistake 7: Letting Winners Grow Too Large
**Problem**: Winner now 25% of portfolio (too much risk)
**Solution**: Trim back to 12-15%, lock in profits

10. **Cash is a Position**: Not "sitting out", it's strategic

## Summary

**The Goldilocks Portfolio**:
- Not too concentrated (>5 positions)
- Not too diluted (<15 positions)
- Not too much in one sector (<50%)
- Not too much at risk (<8% heat)
- Not too much deployed (>80%)
- **Just right**: 8-10 positions, diversified sectors, 5-6% heat, 20% cash

**Remember**: "Diversification is the only free lunch in investing" but too much of anything - even a free lunch - can make you sick.
