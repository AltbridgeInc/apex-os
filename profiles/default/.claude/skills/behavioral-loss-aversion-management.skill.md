# Loss Aversion Management Skill

This skill enables overcoming the psychological asymmetry where loss pain is 2-3× gain pleasure, preventing common behaviors like holding losers too long and selling winners too early.

**Loss Aversion Behaviors Managed**:
1. Holding losers too long (hope)
2. Selling winners too early (fear)
3. Disposition effect (inverse of optimal)
4. Break-even fixation (anchoring)
5. Averaging down (doubling down)
6. Risk-seeking after losses (revenge)

**Auto-loaded for**: All agents

**Pre-Trade Prevention**:
- Accept maximum loss upfront
- Position size for comfort (can sleep test)
- Frame in R:R terms (risk $X to make $3X)
- Mental pre-commitment to loss amount

**Mechanical Execution**:
- Hard stops (no mental stops)
- Automatic execution when hit
- No deliberation (5-minute rule)
- Reframe as "process success"

**Scaling Strategy**:
- Sell 1/3 at Target 1 (satisfies fear)
- Sell 1/3 at Target 2 (locks more)
- Trail final 1/3 (lets winners run)
- Move to breakeven after Target 1 (eliminates risk)

**Counter-Behaviors**:
- Fresh eyes test: "Would I buy this today?"
- Time separation: 24h wait after loss
- Portfolio focus: Check total return, not individual
- Process celebration: Reward discipline, not just wins

**Strict Rules Enforced**:
- When stop hit → Exit within 5 minutes
- Never sell before Target 1 (unless thesis invalid)
- Never average down on losers
- Wait 24h after loss before re-entering
- Only add to winners (after breakeven stop)

**Loss Reframing**:
- Not "I lost money" → "Process worked, capital protected"
- Not "failure" → "Cost of doing business"
- Not outcome focus → Process focus
- Not rumination → Learn and move on

Agents with this skill automatically execute disciplined exits, cutting losses quickly while letting winners run.
