# Financial Health Analysis

## Principle

A company's financial health is assessed through its revenue trends, profitability metrics, cash flow generation, and balance sheet strength. Strong financials indicate sustainable competitive advantage and lower business risk.

## Core Metrics

### Revenue Analysis
- **Revenue Growth Rate**: YoY growth over 3-5 years
- **Revenue Consistency**: Predictable vs volatile
- **Revenue Quality**: Recurring (SaaS) vs one-time (project-based)
- **Cyclicality**: Sensitivity to economic cycles

**Strong**: 10%+ consistent YoY growth, high recurring revenue
**Weak**: Declining or highly volatile, one-time project dependency

### Profitability Metrics
- **Gross Margin**: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- **Operating Margin**: Operating Income / Revenue
- **Net Margin**: Net Income / Revenue
- **Trend**: Expanding, stable, or contracting margins

**Strong**: Gross margin >40%, expanding operating margins
**Weak**: Gross margin <20%, contracting margins

### Cash Flow Analysis
- **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**: Cash from operations
- **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: OCF - Capital Expenditures
- **Cash Conversion**: FCF / Net Income (should be >1)
- **FCF Yield**: FCF / Market Cap

**Strong**: FCF >100% of net income, growing FCF
**Weak**: Negative FCF, declining cash generation

### Balance Sheet Strength
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
- **Current Ratio**: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- **Interest Coverage**: EBIT / Interest Expense
- **Cash Position**: Cash & equivalents on hand

**Strong**: D/E <0.5, current ratio >2, interest coverage >5x
**Weak**: D/E >2, current ratio <1, interest coverage <2x

## Evaluation Criteria

### Score 9-10 (Excellent)
- Revenue growing >15% YoY consistently
- Expanding margins across all levels
- Strong FCF with >100% cash conversion
- Fortress balance sheet (low debt, high cash)
- Industry-leading profitability

### Score 7-8 (Strong)
- Revenue growing 10-15% YoY
- Stable to slightly improving margins
- Positive and growing FCF
- Healthy balance sheet
- Above-average profitability vs peers

### Score 5-6 (Average)
- Revenue growing 5-10% YoY
- Stable margins
- Positive but inconsistent FCF
- Manageable debt levels
- In-line profitability with peers

### Score 3-4 (Weak)
- Revenue growing <5% or declining
- Contracting margins
- Inconsistent or negative FCF
- High debt levels
- Below-average profitability

### Score 0-2 (Poor)
- Revenue declining consistently
- Negative or severely contracting margins
- Burning cash (negative FCF)
- Dangerous debt levels
- Unprofitable or distressed

## Red Flags

- **Accounting Quality Issues**: Revenue recognition games, frequent restatements
- **Deteriorating Margins**: Gross or operating margins compressing
- **Cash Flow Divergence**: Net income up but FCF down (earnings quality issue)
- **Debt Spiral**: Debt increasing faster than revenue/assets
- **Working Capital Issues**: Receivables/inventory ballooning

## Application

### Pre-Investment
- Review 5 years of financials (10-K, 10-Q)
- Compare to industry peers
- Calculate all key metrics
- Identify trends (improving/stable/deteriorating)
- Assign financial health score (0-10)

### During Hold Period
- Monitor quarterly earnings
- Track margin trends
- Watch cash flow generation
- Check for deterioration in metrics
- Update financial health score

### Exit Triggers
- Significant margin compression (>500 bps)
- FCF turns negative for 2+ quarters
- Debt spike without clear ROI
- Revenue growth decelerates sharply
- Accounting irregularities discovered

## Best Practices

1. **Look Beyond Headlines**: GAAP net income can be manipulated; focus on cash flow
2. **Compare to Peers**: Absolute metrics matter less than relative position
3. **Trend Over Snapshot**: One quarter is noise; 4 quarters is a trend
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: $1B revenue at 50% margin beats $2B at 10% margin
5. **Cash is King**: Profitable on paper means nothing if burning cash

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring cash flow (focusing only on P&L)
- Not adjusting for one-time items
- Missing working capital deterioration
- Accepting accounting explanations without scrutiny
- Comparing incomparable companies (different business models)

## Resources

- Company 10-K and 10-Q filings (SEC EDGAR)
- Earnings transcripts and presentations
- Industry reports for peer comparison
- Cash flow statements (most important document)

## Integration with APEX-OS

- **fundamental-analyst** agent applies this principle
- Financial health score (0-10) feeds into overall fundamental score
- Changes in financial health trigger portfolio monitoring alerts
- Deterioration can invalidate investment thesis
