# Confirmation Bias Prevention Skill

This skill enables objective analysis by actively seeking contradictory evidence and establishing falsifiable thesis criteria, preventing the tendency to only see confirming information.

**Pre-Investment Controls**:
- Steelman the bear case (strongest possible argument against)
- Devil's advocate exercise (argue against own position)
- Pre-mortem (imagine trade failed, why?)
- Falsification criteria (specific, measurable exit conditions)

**Auto-loaded for**: thesis-writer, fundamental-analyst, portfolio-monitor agents

**During Hold Monitoring**:
- Weekly: Read one bearish article/analysis
- Monthly: Inversion check ("Would I buy today?")
- Continuous: Track falsification triggers
- Weekly: List 3 things that could go wrong

**Required Deliverables**:
- Bull AND bear cases (equally detailed)
- Falsification criteria (specific and measurable)
- Disconfirming evidence review (documented)

**Red Flags Detected**:
- Only reading confirming information
- Rationalizing every negative
- Moving goalposts (changing thesis)
- Dismissing technical signals
- Defensive when questioned

**Structured Tools Applied**:
- Balance sheet method (bull vs bear evidence)
- Outside view (advise friend perspective)
- Time travel test (would I re-enter?)
- 10-10-10 rule (10 min/weeks/months view)

**Exit Triggers Enforced**:
- Falsification criteria met → Exit immediately
- No rationalization permitted
- Objective, not subjective decisions

Agents with this skill automatically seek truth over confirmation, changing minds when facts change.
