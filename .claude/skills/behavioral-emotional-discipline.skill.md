# Emotional Discipline Skill

This skill enables execution of trading plans regardless of fear, greed, hope, or frustration through systematic decision-making and emotional circuit breakers.

**Four Horsemen Management**:
1. **Fear**: Taking profits early, not entering trades
2. **Greed**: Holding past targets, overleveraging
3. **Hope**: Not executing stops, holding losers
4. **Revenge**: Trading after losses to "make it back"

**Auto-loaded for**: All agents

**Pre-Trade Controls**:
- Checklist required before entry (prevents impulsive)
- Plan documented (entry/stop/targets) before execution
- Wait period for FOMO prevention

**During-Trade Controls**:
- Hard stops placed immediately (no mental stops)
- Check once daily only (reduces emotional noise)
- Follow plan mechanically (no deviation)

**Post-Trade Controls**:
- 24-hour wait after loss before re-entering
- Post-mortem without emotion (focus on process)
- Journal emotional state (pattern recognition)

**Circuit Breakers** (Stop Trading If):
- Lost 3% of portfolio in one day
- 3 consecutive losses
- Feeling strong emotion (fear/greed/anger)
- Not following plan
- Overtrading

**Reduction Rules**:
- After 3 losses: Drop to 0.5-1% risk
- After 5+ wins: Maintain standard (resist overconfidence)
- Stressed/emotional: Take 24 hours off

Agents with this skill automatically implement process-driven decision-making that removes emotion from trading.
