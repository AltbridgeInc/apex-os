# Support and Resistance Levels

## Principle

Support and resistance are price levels where supply and demand dynamics create temporary or permanent barriers. These levels represent psychological and technical anchors where price tends to pause, reverse, or consolidate. Identifying these zones is critical for entry/exit timing and risk management.

## Definitions

### Support
**Definition**: Price level where buying pressure overcomes selling pressure, preventing further decline

**Concept**: "Floor" that price bounces off

**Psychology**:
- Buyers remember lower prices and step in
- Previous buyers defend their entry points
- Value buyers see attractive prices

**Strength Indicators**:
- Multiple tests without breaking
- High volume at the level
- Significant price moves away from support

### Resistance
**Definition**: Price level where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure, preventing further advance

**Concept**: "Ceiling" that price struggles to break through

**Psychology**:
- Sellers remember higher prices and sell
- Previous buyers at those levels want to break even
- Profit takers exit positions

**Strength Indicators**:
- Multiple rejections from the level
- High volume at the level
- Significant reversals from resistance

## Types of Support and Resistance

### 1. Horizontal Support/Resistance

**Definition**: Flat price levels where price previously reversed

**How to Identify**:
- Previous swing highs (resistance)
- Previous swing lows (support)
- Consolidation zones (both)
- Gaps (both)

**Rules**:
- Need at least 2 touches to establish
- More touches = stronger level
- Wider time between touches = more significant
- Same level works as both S/R (role reversal)

**Example**:
```
Stock hits $50 (Week 1), drops to $40
Returns to $50 (Week 5), drops again
Returns to $50 (Week 10), drops again
$50 is strong resistance (3 rejections)
```

### 2. Moving Average Support/Resistance

**Key MAs as Dynamic S/R**:
- **20-day MA**: Short-term S/R for momentum stocks
- **50-day MA**: Primary S/R for intermediate trends
- **200-day MA**: Major S/R, institutional level

**In Uptrends**:
- MAs act as support (buy opportunity on pullback to MA)
- 20-day MA most common bounce point
- 50-day MA stronger support
- 200-day MA last line of defense

**In Downtrends**:
- MAs act as resistance (sell opportunity on rally to MA)
- Breaking back above MAs signals potential trend change

**Strength**:
- Longer MA = stronger S/R
- More touches = more reliable
- Steep slope = weaker (price breaks through)

### 3. Trendline Support/Resistance

**Definition**: Diagonal lines connecting swing highs (downtrend) or lows (uptrend)

**In Uptrends**:
- Trendline connecting higher lows = support
- Each touch is buying opportunity
- Break below = trend change warning

**In Downtrends**:
- Trendline connecting lower highs = resistance
- Each touch is selling opportunity
- Break above = trend change possible

**Validation**:
- Need 3 touches minimum to confirm
- More touches = more reliable
- Angles 30-45° most sustainable

### 4. Round Numbers (Psychological Levels)

**Definition**: Even numbers where traders place orders

**Key Levels**:
- Whole numbers: $50, $100, $150
- Half numbers: $25, $50, $75
- Round milestones: $100, $1,000 for expensive stocks

**Psychology**:
- Easy to remember
- Traders cluster orders (stop losses, limit orders)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy

**Significance**:
- Stronger at major numbers ($100 > $95)
- Act as magnet (price drawn to round numbers)
- Often initial support/resistance before exact level found

### 5. Fibonacci Retracements

**Definition**: Ratios from Fibonacci sequence used to predict retracement levels

**Key Levels**:
- **38.2%**: Shallow retracement in strong trends
- **50%**: Mid-point, common retracement
- **61.8%**: Deep retracement, trend testing

**How to Use**:
- Draw from swing low to swing high (uptrend)
- Watch for bounces at Fibonacci levels
- Combine with other S/R for confirmation

**In Uptrends**:
- Expect pullback to 38-50% (healthy)
- Pullback to 61.8% (deeper, last chance)
- Break below 61.8% (trend in question)

**Extension Levels** (Profit Targets):
- **161.8%**: First extension target
- **261.8%**: Second extension target

### 6. Volume Profile (Price by Volume)

**Definition**: Horizontal histogram showing volume traded at each price

**High Volume Nodes (HVN)**:
- Areas with high past volume
- Act as strong S/R (lots of activity, memory)
- Price tends to consolidate here

**Low Volume Nodes (LVN)**:
- Areas with low past volume
- Price moves through quickly (no resistance)
- Gaps in volume profile

**Usage**:
- HVN = expect S/R
- LVN = expect fast moves
- Combine with price-based S/R

## Support and Resistance Zones

**Concept**: S/R is not a precise line, but a zone

**Zone Definition**:
- Support zone: $48-50 (not exactly $50)
- Resistance zone: $98-100 (not exactly $100)

**Why Zones?**:
- Different traders use different timeframes/candles
- Wicks vs bodies vary
- Round numbers create range

**Trading Zones**:
- **Buy Zone**: Support zone (not exact bottom)
- **Sell Zone**: Resistance zone (not exact top)
- Use limit orders within zones
- Stops just outside zones

## Role Reversal

**Critical Concept**: Broken support becomes resistance, broken resistance becomes support

**Upside Breakout**:
```
Old resistance at $100 → Price breaks to $110 → Pulls back to $100
Old resistance now acts as support (test of breakout)
```

**Downside Breakdown**:
```
Old support at $50 → Price breaks to $45 → Rallies back to $50
Old support now acts as resistance (selling opportunity)
```

**Why This Happens**:
- Traders who missed breakout buy pullback to old level
- Breakout buyers defend their entry (old resistance)
- Previous sellers at old level become buyers

**Trading Implication**:
- After breakout, wait for test of old R (now S) = low-risk entry
- Failed test (break back below old R) = failed breakout, exit

## Strength of S/R Levels

### Very Strong S/R (Score 9-10)
- Held 5+ times over 6+ months
- Clear, dramatic reversals
- High volume at the level
- Visible across multiple timeframes
- Round number coinciding with technical level
- 200-day MA reinforcing the level

### Strong S/R (Score 7-8)
- Held 3-4 times over 3+ months
- Good reactions
- Moderate volume
- Visible on daily and weekly charts

### Moderate S/R (Score 5-6)
- Held 2 times
- Some reactions
- Visible primarily on daily chart
- Minor level

### Weak S/R (Score 3-4)
- Only 1 test
- Minimal reaction
- Intraday level only
- May not hold

## Breaks and False Breaks

### Legitimate Break
**Characteristics**:
- Break on high volume (1.5-2x average)
- Close beyond level (not just a wick)
- Follow-through next day
- No immediate return to level

**Confirmation**: 2-3 days of closes beyond level

### False Break (Fakeout)
**Characteristics**:
- Break on low volume
- Wicks through but closes back
- Immediate reversal (within 1-2 days)
- Returns quickly to range

**Trading Implication**: Fakeouts often lead to strong moves in opposite direction (stop hunters trapped)

### Stop Hunt
**Definition**: Brief break through S/R to trigger stop losses, then reversal

**Pattern**:
```
Support at $50 → Brief drop to $49 (triggers stops) →
Immediate reversal back above $50 → Rally ensues
```

**Protection**: Place stops slightly below/above S/R zones, not at obvious levels

## Application in Trading

### Entry Points

**Buying at Support**:
- Wait for price to enter support zone
- Look for reversal signals (hammer candle, volume increase)
- Enter when support holds (not before)
- Stop just below support zone

**Selling at Resistance**:
- Wait for price to enter resistance zone
- Look for rejection signals (shooting star, high volume)
- Enter when resistance holds
- Stop just above resistance zone

### Stop Loss Placement

**Buy Setup**:
- Stop 2-3% below support level
- Accounts for noise and wicks
- If support breaks, exit (setup failed)

**Short Setup**:
- Stop 2-3% above resistance level
- If resistance breaks, cover (setup failed)

### Profit Targets

**From Support**:
- Target 1: Mid-point to resistance
- Target 2: Resistance level
- Target 3: Extension beyond resistance

**From Breakout**:
- Target: Add range height to breakout level
- Example: $50-60 range breaks up → Target = $60 + $10 = $70

## S/R Scoring Criteria

### Pre-Investment
- Identify 2-3 key support levels below current price
- Identify 2-3 key resistance levels above
- Map moving averages as dynamic S/R
- Note round numbers in the vicinity
- Check volume profile for high-volume nodes
- Assign S/R score (0-10) based on clarity

**Score 9-10**: Multiple clear, tested S/R levels with high volume confirmation
**Score 7-8**: Clear primary S/R with some secondary levels
**Score 5-6**: Some S/R visible but not well-defined
**Score 3-4**: Weak or ambiguous S/R
**Score 0-2**: No clear S/R levels (avoid)

### During Hold Period
- Monitor if key levels holding
- Watch for role reversal after breakouts
- Update key levels as new S/R forms
- Track moving average support/resistance

### Exit Triggers
- Break below key support on volume (long position)
- Failure to break resistance after multiple tests (stalling)
- Breakdown below rising trendline support

## Best Practices

1. **Draw on Weekly First**: More significant levels than daily
2. **Use Zones, Not Lines**: Give levels 2-3% wiggle room
3. **Volume Confirms**: S/R with volume confirmation is strongest
4. **Multiple Timeframes**: Level visible on multiple TFs is most reliable
5. **Fewer is Better**: Mark only the most obvious levels (avoid cluttering chart)
6. **Test = Opportunity**: Each test of S/R is a trading opportunity

## Common Mistakes

- Drawing too many levels (paralysis by analysis)
- Treating S/R as exact prices (they're zones)
- Ignoring moving averages as dynamic S/R
- Not accounting for role reversal after breaks
- Placing stops exactly at S/R (get stop hunted)
- Buying before support tested (anticipating)
